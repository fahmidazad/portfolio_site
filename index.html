                    <p class="large text-muted"> Hi! I'm Fahmida. I'm an UX/UI designer based in New York City. Before discovering my passion for UX/UI, I majored in Psychology, taught in the West Bank, and worked as a crisis-responder for human trafficking survivors at a national hotline. These experiences have cultivated in me a deep sense of empathy for the person I'm serving. Whether I'm working with a student, a hotline caller, or an user, my focus is always on what I can do to find the best solution for that person's needs. Being curious, seeing patterns and solving problems with creativity has been an integral part of doing this successfully.<br> </br> I truly believe human centered design can solve society’s most pressing challenges. I am strongly process driven and my designs place the user’s needs first to create simple and accessible experiences. You can check out some of my client projects below. </p>

                            <p class="large text-muted">The Pulseband is a concept wearable device specifically geared towards those who are suffering from heart conditions or those who are at risk of heart conditions. The device provides users with information regarding their heart rate, blood presssure, physical activity and sleep patterns. At DESIGNATION, I along with two other team members were tasked with designing a companion mobile app for this device which would visualize for the user what the Pulseband was tracking for them. Below is a picture of the Pulseband with a few other product details. </p>

                            <img id="pulseband-product-detail-img" class="img-responsive" src="img/band_details.png">

                            <h2> The Challenge </h2>
                                <p class="large text-muted">How do we create an user-centric companion app that both empowers and informs the user of their heart health without the information being too technical or overwhelming? </p>
                            <h2> The Process </h2>
                                <p class="large text-muted"> We had two weeks for this project! It was an immense undertaking with a lot of research to be done. Following agile methodology and using a scrum board to keep track of our responsibilities, our small team of three worked very closely and collaboratively to constantly iterate on our ideas. We all wore different hats during each phase. My role was to serve as the primary UX researcher, though I was intimately involved for each design decision for our final mockups. We completed the project with the following phases in place.</p>

                            <h3> Ideation & Research </h2>
                                <p class="large text-muted"> We started off with several whiteboarding sessions brainstorming key research questions we were interested in.</p> 

                                <img class="img-responsive pb-image" src="img/PulsebandBrainstorm4.jpg">


                              <p class="large text-muted"> We then created a UX Strategy Blueprint to guide our research plan. We had to break down our key goals, understand our challenges and figure out the best way to gather the information that we needed. </p>

                             <img class="img-responsive" src="img/PBstratblueprint-02.png">

                              <p class="large text-muted"> We conducted a comprehensive competitive analysis phase researching top fitness wearables in the market. We looked at everything from functionality of popular fitness bands, price ranges, aesthetics and most importantly user reviews. What we discovered is that unlike patients, fitness enthusiasts are excited to track data and often come from higher socio economic backgrounds. Patients who are older and are suffering from health problems do not display similar behavioral patterns. This was an important discovery during our reasearch phase that led to important design decisions later on in the process. </p>

We identified key words, emotions, and adjectives first and then went onto look for visual inspiration. That process led us to create our visual assets for the mobile app. We wanted to create an interface that was informative and medical, but didn't look sterile or intimidating. Below is our UI Kit, our Style Tile as well as a few examples of our mid fidelity mockups. </p>

                                <p class="large text-muted">GigScout is a mobile platform that visualizes where live music is nearby, and allows the user to preview the music before making arrangements to go to the show. At DESIGNATION Labs, I worked with two other team members to conduct an usability audit on the existing app, identify gaps, and provide strategic direction to recreate a more robust landing page for their web presence. As a primary UX researcher, I also developed prototypes for a potential web platform for GigScout. </p>

                            <h2> The Challenge </h2>
                                <p class="large text-muted">How do we enhance GigScout's existing web presence to increase engagement? </p>

                            <h2> The Process </h2>
                                <p class="large text-muted">   With this project, we had to be mindful of our limitations. The research that we set out to do, and the insights that we gathered were not necessarily for introducig new features or adding onto existing features. Rather, our work targeted being able to understand what users find valuable, how they find out about live music events currently, and being able to understand behavior trends so that we can highlight what sets GigScout apart from its competitors. We completed the project with the following phases in place. </p>

                                    <p class="large text-muted"> We started with first taking a comprehensive look at where GigScout stands currently. I co-conducted a comprehensive heuristic evaluation on the existing app. My team member and I played around with the app and asked others to use it and then documented their feedback. Below is a snapshot of our heuristic evaluation. </p>

                                    <p class="large text-muted">I researched behavior trends amongst live music goers, particularly focusing on behaviors influencing mobile interactions for folks who are 18-34. We conducted a survey capturing data from over 60 self identified live music enthusiasts in the same age group and held in-person interviews to figure out how music enthusiasts currently discover live music, how they plan for it, what things they look for in the tools they use and how often they use it. Below is a snapshot of our findings.</p>

                            <h2> Background </h2>
                                <p class="large text-muted">Dashtag is a lightweight rails application that aggregates and visualizes hashtags. It pulls specific hashtags from Instagram, Twitter, or both, and displays them using 
                                    <a href="http://masonry.desandro.com/"> masonry </a>. Dashtag was created by a group of developers at 
                                    <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">Thoughtworks</a>. <br> </br>

                                    When I joined the team, information regarding all of the steps necessary to set up a Dashtag page was located in a single file. Because it was a collaborative project, different developers added on different pieces of information to the document as they were building the application out. The process of setting up a Dashtag page was very confusing to figure out for a non-technical person. The creators of Dashtag wanted to create a landing page, and create an interface that would allow anyone to be able to set up their customized Dashtag page with ease.</p>

                            <h2> The Challenge </h2>
                                <p class="large text-muted"> How do we get people to set up their own Dashtag page? How do we synthesize the steps that are required to do so in the simplest, most intuitive way? </p>

                            <h2> The Process </h2> 

                                <p class="large text-muted"> The overall goal of this project was to provide all the information necessary to create a Dashtag page right on the landing site. This required many stakeholder interviews to understand their goals and understand the target audience for this application. I also went through the steps of creating a Dashtag page many times to identify painpoints. I worked on this project with the following phases in place. </p>

                            <h3> Information Architecture </h3>
                            <p class="large text-muted"> The first step for me was to take the existing data and compartmentalize the information into different sections. I created the following site map which helped the developers visualize how many steps are involved for an user in this process. </p>

                                <p class="large text-muted"> Before building a working prototype, I first wanted to go through the experience of not only setting up a Dashtag page, but also hosting a Twitter chat with another organizer to gauge if participants would engage with Dashtag. Working with the <a href="http://www.washingtonpeacecenter.org/">Washington Peace Center</a>, I co-organized a twitter chat about public safety for Muslim women. We publicized the event widely, came up with a structure for the Twitter chat, and invited service organizations both from the U.S. and abroad to take part. We wanted to see if these organizations would find it appealing to use the Dashtag page as a resource, or as an engagement tool afterwards. </p>

                                </div>

                                <p class="large text-muted">Going through this process provided tremendous insights. We noticed roadblocks that we didn't notice before, particularly regarding the sequence of directions that a user would need. We also documented how participants of the Twitter chat interacted with the Dashtag page.</p>

                           <h2> Background </h2>
                                <p class="large text-muted"> Child's Cup Full started as a university student group and has now become a social enterprise with an international audience. One of their key challenges was how the brand was being perceived. Since its inception, it has had a loyal customer base, however the visual identity of the organization did not convey the messages that the team wanted to convey. Child's Cup Full sells hand-crafted, eco-friendly and educational toys for kids ages two to seven and all of the toys are handmade by refugee women artisans in the West Bank. The team wanted a tailored design direction that showed energy, vibrancy and youthfulness in its brand but also an identity that kept true to its founding story and values. I was brought on board to provide strategic visual design direction for both physical and digital branding materials during the re-branding process.</p>

                            <h2> The Challenge </h2>
                                <p class="large text-muted"> How can we rebrand Child's Cup Full so that people engage with it as a global, ethical, social enterprise rather than a charity organization? </p>

                            <h2> The Process </h2>
                                <p class= "large text-muted"> We started off with many brainstorming sessions, meetings with the founder of the organization as well as other stakeholders and spent extensive amounts of time on research and gathering visual inspiration. I worked closely with the Associate Director of the organization to gain an in depth understanding of the organization's history, its values, its audience base and their short and long term design goals. The rebranding of the logo, providing a style guide, and creating collateral items that would be distributed physically and digitally required an agile and iterative approach. </p>


                            <h2> Visual Design </h2>
                                <p class="large text-muted"> One of the key deliverables I worked on was producing a comprehensive visual design strategy deck to break down the logic and reasoning behind each decision. Below are samples from that deck.  <br> </br>
